# Spring, GraphQL, H2

***Phase 1: Spring + H2 Database + Data Initialization***

* Choose H2 as your relational database management system.

* Create a database schema with two tables: "users" and "posts". The "users" table should have columns for "id" (a
  unique identifier), "name", and "email". The "posts" table should have columns for "id" (a unique identifier), "
  title", "body", and "user_id" (a foreign key that references the "id" column in the "users" table).

* Define the entity classes in your Spring project that will map to the tables in your database. For example, you might
  create a "User" class and a "Post" class that correspond to the "users" and "posts" tables, respectively.

* Configure Spring to use an ORM framework such as Hibernate to automatically generate SQL queries and manage database
  transactions.

* Write a data initialization script to populate your database with some sample data. This will make it easier to test
  your GraphQL API later on. You can use tools like Flyway or Liquibase to manage database migrations.

* Write unit tests to verify that your entity classes and data initialization script are working correctly.

***Phase 2: Simple GraphQL API to Read Data***

* Define a GraphQL schema that specifies the types of queries that your API will support. For example, you might define
  a "User" type and a "Post" type, along with queries to retrieve all users and all posts.

* Write resolver functions in Java to handle each of the queries in your schema. These resolver functions will be
  responsible for fetching the data from the database and returning it to the client.

* Configure your Spring project to use a GraphQL library such as graphql-java to process incoming GraphQL requests and
  map them to the appropriate resolver functions.

* Integrate Swagger into your Spring project to automatically generate API documentation.

* Configure Swagger to document your GraphQL API endpoints and their input/output types.

* Write unit tests to verify that your resolver functions are working correctly.

***Phase 3: Advanced GraphQL API to Modify Data***

* Define additional mutations in your GraphQL schema to enable modifications to your data. For example, you might define
  a "createPost" mutation to allow users to create new posts.

* Write resolver functions in Java to handle each of the mutations in your schema. These resolver functions will be
  responsible for modifying the data in the database and returning the updated data to the client.

* Configure your Spring project to use the same GraphQL library to handle incoming mutation requests.

* Write unit tests to verify that your resolver functions are working correctly.

***Phase 4: Write Separate Client for GraphQL API***

* Write a separate client application that can communicate with your GraphQL API.

* Use a GraphQL client library such as Apollo or Relay to make requests to your API and retrieve data.

* Write unit tests to verify that your client application is working correctly.
